# How to create custom column chooser allowing column multi select


<p>Imagine that you have dozens of columns and you need to add them to your grid view from a column chooser. It's very inconvenient to drag and drop them one by one and it would be great to have a possibility of selecting them at once and sending to the grid view altogether. This example demonstrates what to do with the column chooser to achieve this behavior. Here we created a ColumnCustomizationListBox descendant with the capability to draw a check box across every column in the column chooser's list box. Also we have added a button to the bottom of column chooser. So now you can check columns you need and send them to the grid view by pressing the button.</p>
